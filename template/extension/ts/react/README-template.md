This is a [spice-dev](https://projects.sanooj.uk/spicetify/spice-dev) project.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

The Extension will be applied automatically in dev and build. To override the
behavior use `--no-apply`

Starts a development server at [http://localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030)
for communication with Spotify.

You can start editing by modifying `src/app.tsx`. The extension auto-updates
(Reloads Spotify) as you edit the file.
